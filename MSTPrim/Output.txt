MST :  |0 -> 3 weight: 2| |1 -> 3 weight: 5| |2 -> 3 weight: 3| |2 -> 4 weight: 7| MST cost: 17 
The edge that didn't changed the MST:  : |2 -> 1 weight: 10| 
The edge that changed the MST:  : |1 -> 2 weight: 2| 
New MST:  :  |0 -> 3 weight: 2| |1 -> 2 weight: 2| |2 -> 3 weight: 3| |2 -> 4 weight: 7| MST cost: 14
